# Geolocations API

The application automatically assigns geolocations to systems based on available data, but these defaults might not always reflect your organization's preferred location structure.

The Geolocations API enables you to define and manage geolocations when the default assignments are incomplete or inaccurate. For example, in some cases, VPNs, network architecture, or data gaps might lead to incorrect system placement.

With these endpoints, you can do the following:

- Create, update, and delete custom geolocations.
- View both default and custom geolocation assignments.

Use this API when you need greater control over how systems are geographically represented within your environment.

## GET geolocations

This endpoint returns all available geolocations, including both default and custom entries that can be assigned to systems based on IP ranges.

### Request Syntax

```
GET /api/geolocations
```
