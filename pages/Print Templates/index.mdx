# Print Templates

This section includes examples of templates I\'ve designed for print
outputs, such as PDFs.

> **Note:** I created these PDF templates and the PDF content in an XML authoring tool
to enable a team to publish the same content to web sites, PDFs, and
Word documents that share all the same visual elements. These are not
PowerPoint or Word templates (but I do know how to work with those as
well).
