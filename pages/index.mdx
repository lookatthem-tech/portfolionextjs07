## About me

I\'m a writer with many years of experience in creating content of all
kinds. Currently, I write
[API documentation](APIDocs/APIDocsLanding.htm), technical and
non-technical content, marketing and promotional content, software and
hardware content, print and online content, and more. Check out my
[LinkedIn
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-rader-43042910/)
to see full details about what I\'ve done and where I\'ve done it.

> **Note:** I built, edited, versioned, and deployed this site in github. I designed
this portfolio to resemble a custom help center that I made for one
software company. The sections of this portfolio (such as Software,
Hardware, Developers, etc.) include content that I\'ve created for that
specific purpose or audience.

EDIT!!!! This portfolio is just a small sampling of what I have done and what I
can do. If you would like to see more examples or have any questions,
feel free to contact me on
